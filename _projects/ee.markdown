The brief from EE was to drive the sales of EE SIM cards amongst data hungry people. Our solution was to create the EE Limited Editions project, which enabled influential YouTube ambassadors to create their own mobile network for their fans, with bespoke content and unique interaction.

The project garnered over 50,000 new customers in just 3 months and £millions in revenue for EE.
