The brief from EE was to drive the sales of EE SIM cards amongst data hungry young people. Our solution was to create the EE Limited Editions SIM, which enabled influential YouTubers to create their own mobile network for their fans, with bespoke content.

The project garnered over 50,000 new customers in just 3 months and £millions in revenue for EE.
