Working with Castrol to take their Titanium Trial global content platform to the next level by driving engagement and earned coverage.

We worked closely with Castrol to create the world’s first Titanium Trial you can play as well as watch by partnering with the world’s biggest driving game, Need For Speed and developing an in-game Castrol EDGE mission.

Over 2 million people have played the Castrol EDGE Titanium Trial and more than 30,000 gamers had shared videos of themselves playing the Titanium Trial on YouTube within 24 hours of launch.
