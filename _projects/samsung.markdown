In order to really get under the skin of the project, EARN delved deep into the Samsung brand and its history and created a set of guidelines that determined how the Samsung brand should manifest itself across the marketing mix.

The result was the creation of a Samsung Brand Activation Manual, a book used by the Samsung marketing team, to win millions of new fans.
