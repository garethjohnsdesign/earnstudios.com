### Brief
Qualcomm asked us for help demonstrating the groundbreaking power of their technology. So, what did we do? We launched the first ever drone race at Wembley Stadium.

### Solution
Working together with ERSA (the European Rotor Sports Association) we created an event that brings fans closer to the action of Drone Racing.

### Results
One billion media impacts
