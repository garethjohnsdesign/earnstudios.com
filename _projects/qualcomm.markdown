Qualcomm asked us for help demonstrating the ground-breaking power of their technology. So, what did we do? We launched the first ever drone race at Wembley Stadium. 

Working together with ERSA (the European Rotor Sports Association) we created an event that brings fans closer to the action of Drone Racing. Marrying the technologies of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chip with EE 4Gee Action Cams over EE’s 4G network at the world famous Wembley Stadium, selected industry journalists were invited to experience the race as if they themselves were pilots. 

The activity resulted in 1 billion media impacts.
