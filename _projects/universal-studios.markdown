We were tasked by Universal Studios to find creative ways to drive box office sales and pre-booking for Fast & Furious 8.

Working with a collective of street artists and film’s producers, we created a collection of 12 bespoke digital posters and rewarded fans that pre-booked at any cinema around the world on the first two weeks of theatrical release.
