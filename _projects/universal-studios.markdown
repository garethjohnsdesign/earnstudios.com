We were tasked by Universal Studios to find creative ways to drive box office sales and pre-booking for Fast & Furious 8.

Working with a collective of street artists, we created a collection of 12 bespoke digital posters and rewarded fans that pre-booked at any cinema around the world on the first two weeks of theatrical release.

Fast & Furious 8 smashed global box office records, previously held by Star Wars. The project was activated in 52 markets with 37 languages, the largest film promotion uptake in Universal’s history.
