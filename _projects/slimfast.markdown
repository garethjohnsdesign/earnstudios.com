SlimFast brought us a a brief to develop an idea to amplify their existing 2016 marketing plan.
EARN developed a modern version of the SlimFast Challenge. Building on the legacy and awareness of the original SlimFast Challenge, we developed the next generation version; one that is in line with the SlimFast brandâ€™s vision to modernise and drive reappraisal amongst consumers, whilst also winning new consumers.

Our solution gave SlimFast an authentic reason to engage with consumers and provided a wealth of content, tools and assets to be activated across all of their channels (Twitter, Instagram, website, newsletters, PR, advertising and ambassadors.)

There were over 40,000 registrations for the SlimFast Challenge via the newly created app. And over 5,000 active and vocal Facebook group members; helping to establish a community around the brand supporting each other and engaging with SlimFast.
