Huel is a nutritionally complete powdered food ​that contains all the proteins, carbs, and fats you need, plus at least 100% of the European Union’s “Daily Recommended Amounts” of all 26 essential vitamins and minerals. So you know you won’t be deficient in any essential nutrients. Huel is 100% vegan (better for the environment and animals), super convenient, requires minimal packaging and has a shelf life of 12 months (so zero food waste).
