bp pulse (bp's EV charging provider) partnered with Earn Studios to take the bold step into music sponsorship with the aim of driving awareness, strengthening brand perception and delivering commercial impact. 

We created a tiered sponsorship strategy across grassroots, events and venues, and invented a brand platform - Every EV is a VIP - to reward and incentivise EV journeys across our sponsored platforms.
