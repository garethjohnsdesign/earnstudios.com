bp pulse (bp's EV charging provider) partnered with Earn Studios to take the bold step into music sponsorship with the aim of driving awareness, strengthening brand perception and delivering commercial impact.

We created a tiered sponsorship strategy across grassroots, events and venues, and invented a brand platform — Every EV is a VIP — to reward and incentivise EV journeys across our sponsored platforms.

A selection of campaign highlights from the project:

*Naming rights of the NEC Arena in Birmingham, host to the world's top music acts with 800,000 visitors a year.*

*Creation of the bp pulse EVIP Lounge — a premium space at bp pulse LIVE exclusively for EV drivers and their guests.*

*Headline partner to CarFest — DJ Chris Evans' 3-day festival combining music and motors. EV drivers were rewarded with entry to the EVIP Lounge and bp pulse EV charging vouchers.*
