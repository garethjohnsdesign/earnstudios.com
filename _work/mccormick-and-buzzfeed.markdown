We worked with McCormick, the 130 year-old seasoning manufacturer, and BuzzFeed’s food publication Tasty to co-develop and launch Tasty-branded seasonings.

For McCormick, which usually sells in supermarkets, it’s an opportunity to reach millennial chefs and to directly get both customer data and distribution – usually the privilege of DTC companies.

> “DTC and ecommerce are fast growing channels, especially with millennials, so McCormick wanted to ensure we had a strong, unique presence. Tasty is teaching a new generation to cook and Tasty branding on product brings additional credibility with consumers – they trust the Tasty brand.”

**Anthony Palmer, Senior Director of Global Consumer Strategy, McCormick**

For BuzzFeed, selling co-branded products is a revenue opportunity that supplements its ad business to the tune of $50mn in 2018. The cooking brand expanded beyond its viral videos to cookbook deals and kitchen products sold at Walmart and Macy’s.

McCormick’s research and development team worked with Tasty to come up with Tasty Seasoning Blends, which launches with five flavours: Fiery, Zesty, Savory, Jazzy and Hearty.![mccormick-spice-kit-us-inside.jpg](/uploads/mccormick-spice-kit-us-inside.jpg)McCormick and BuzzFeed will advertise the spice blends with sponsored posts on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and newsletters, as well as use the spices in future Tasty videos.

The spices will sell online, followed by a global retail rollout starting in June in the US and Canada.
