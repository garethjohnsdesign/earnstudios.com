As AB InBev celebrates making history by becoming the first brand to win back-to-back Creative Marketer of the Year at the Cannes Lions Festival, their creative transformation is still in motion — and that’s what makes it remarkable. Their mantra is simple: keep learning, stay ambitious, and solve business and consumer challenges through creativity. From global brand VPs to young managers, the entire marketing team now works from a shared playbook and a mindset that never settles.

At Earn Studios, we’ve been proud to play a small part in that journey. For the past five years, our Founder has sat on AB InBev’s Global and European Creative Council and Braintrusts alongside brand leaders of Budweiser, Stella Artois, Corona, and Michelob Ultra — sharing honest feedback, fresh perspective, and a shared commitment to make every idea stronger.

The partnership has shaped us too. It’s shown how openness, trust and clear creative standards can elevate not just a campaign, but a culture. 

AB InBev’s story is one of continuous improvement and creative courage — proof that when clients and partners dream big together, they can build the world’s most admired marketing team. And the journey, thankfully, is far from over.
