### Our aim with our business planning workshops is to show in–house teams how to think differently and develop innovative, commercially minded solutions to common business challenges.

Led by Jamal Benmiloud, former VP of Marketing at Red Bull and Monster and author of Brand Love: How to build a brand worth talking about, we use live briefs and business challenges that come directly from you, to build ideas and plans that create value and drive long term growth whilst also building brand love.

### One-Day Workshops
Our one-day workshops include talks, Q&As and interactive groups sessions tailored to specific requirements. 

### Topics include

- Understanding the key to building and maintaining brand love
- Unlocking an entrepreneurial mindset (from marketeers to entrepreneurs)
- Internal alignment on business objectives and the road map to get there
- Generating value based ideas that drive revenue and achieve company goals
- Developing entrepreneurial and astute business plans designed for long term growth

EARN are committed to helping our clients’ marketing to become a long-term business asset that grows in value. We partner with businesses that can make change happen and it is our priority to create value and nurture the entrepreneurial spirit to drive long-term growth.
