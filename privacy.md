## Privacy Policy

The purpose of this privacy policy is to inform our clients, employees, business partners, and the general public how we protect and handle private and sensitive information. At Earn Studios we are committed to protecting your privacy through stringent privacy practices. Our privacy policy is subject to change at any time and we encourage you to periodically review this page for updates to determine if you still agree to the policy. Earn Studios may collect personal information provided by you — name, address, demographic information, etc. — and store those details in a database. You may choose to provide Earn Studios with additional personal information by completing our online forms. We will inform you of how your personal information will be used at the point of collection, and Earn Studios will only use your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. In addition to your personal and demographic information, when you visit an Earn Studios website your web browser software may automatically provide us with information such as the browser name and version, your computer type, operating system, and the previous website you visited if you clicked a link to our site from another website. We also automatically determine your internet IP address or your internet service provider’s IP address. Any of this information may be recorded in our system logs or securely collected on our behalf via third-party services. This information will only be used internally in anonymous, aggregate reporting. The collected information may be used to generate follow-up messages and responses that are tailored to your request. Earn Studios does not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. Earn Studios is fully committed to the proper handling and privacy of the personal information that it collects or uses. Adherence to this policy applies to all employees who work for Earn Studios and applies to all data and information collected by Earn Studios that allows for identification of an individual (personal information or personal identifiable information). If you have not chosen to “opt out” from our mailings, we may also use the collected information to send you periodic newsletters and other mailings.

On subsequent visits to our site, your browser will automatically re-transmit the cookie data to our site. We may use cookies to customise the content shown to you, to provide conveniences to your browsing experience or to track aggregate traffic trends on our site. You are not required to accept and store cookies to browse our websites. Our websites contain links to other sites. Earn Studios does not share your personal information with these sites, nor do we have any control over the privacy policies of those sites. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of the companies responsible for those sites.

## Employee

Information We collect and use employee information only for business purposes, and our employees’ personal information is never sold or rented to third parties. Employee information, including personal identifiable information, performance and disciplinary information, health related information, or other sensitive employee information is only accessible by Earn Studios employees who have legitimate human resource purposes and/or a business need to know.

## Choice

Earn Studios will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of having your personal information (1) disclosed to a third party who is not currently working for Earn Studios, and (2) used for a purpose that is different from the original use purpose when it was collected or authorised for use by you. The only exception to this choice is the requirement of disclosure of personal information by government or judicial order, or other legal requirements. You can choose to opt-out of marketing materials from EARN Studios at any time. If you have any additional questions or would like to be removed from our database, please email [hello@earnstudios.com](mailto:hello@earnstudios.com)

## Accountability for Onward Transfer of Personal Data

Earn Studios will not transfer personal information to third parties unless such third parties have entered into an agreement in writing that requires them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection to your personal information as our stringent privacy practices. Earn Studios only transfers data to agents or third-party service providers who have a legitimate need to the information in order to provide services on behalf of Earn Studios.

## Security

Earn Studios is committed to protecting the Personal Information that it collects and stores, and we have implemented  technical,  operational,  and  administrative  security  measures  to  prevent  the loss, misuse, disclosure, alteration, theft, or destruction of such information.

## Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation

Earn Studios only  collects  and  retains  Personal  Information  that  is  relevant  to  the  purposes  for which it is collected. Personal information will not be used in a way that is incompatible with such purposes, unless such  use  as  been  explicitly  authorised by you. Earn Studios will take  reasonable steps  to  preserve  the  integrity  of  your personal  information  and  to  ensure that it  is  reliable  for  its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. Prophet may contact you to verify that the data we have is accurate and current.

## Access

You have the right  to  access  and  correct  your  personal  information  data  that  is  used  by Earn Studios. You can correct, amend, or request that information is deleted if it is inaccurate. The only exception to an  access  request  for  personal  information  is  where  the  burden  or  expense  of providing  access  would  be  disproportionate  to  the  risks  to  the  individual’s  privacy  in  the  case  in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. To confirm that Earn Studios has personal data relating to you, or to make any other access or correction requests, contact us at [hello@earnstudios.com](mailto:hello@earnstudios.com).

## Recourse, Enforcement and Liability

We will investigate  your  complaint  thoroughly,  and will respond to you within 30 days from the time we were notified.

A list of DPAs can be found [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm). Regarding the onward transfers  of  personal  data, Earn  Studios is responsible  for  the  processing  of  personal  information  it  receives  and  subsequently  transfers  to  a third  party  acting  as  an  agent  on  its  behalf. Earn Studios shall  remain  liable  if  its  agent  processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with agreements in writing that requires them to provide  at  least  the  same  level  of  privacy  protection  for  personal  information  as Earn  Studios’ stringent privacy practices, unless Earn Studios proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
