In a world where the average customer grows up seeing 170,000 marketing messages by their 17th birthday; where 86% of people admit to sharing social media content in the bathroom; where 20% of smartphone users have installed ad-blocking browsers because of their loathing of advertising; customers only talk about the brands they LOVE. And, if customers aren’t talking about your brand, you might as well not exist.

Fans don’t just “like” these brands, they love them and help build them. And the good news is that it’s not exclusive to cool, cutting-edge brands. Brand Love is as achievable to all brands. Whether you’re a bank, an airline or selling drinks.

## What we do
We are an entrepreneurial creative team. We exist to earn brand love with brave clients. We do this by inventing pioneering products, services, experiences and content platforms.

## Who we are
What if a rally driver and footballer worked together to create a new sport? Or a YouTube Vlogger worked with a Mobile network to create a new product just for their fans? EARN is a collaborative team of creatives, strategists, marketers, inventors and entrepreneurs from a wide variety of backgrounds. We’ve come to EARN to bring our creations into the real world for our clients. We love the challenge of the seemingly impossible and the potential to have an impact on millions of people’s lives. Although we are a team of thinkers, we don’t have all the answers. So we also work closely with industry experts and commercial partners around the world to solve your problems. We also invest in our own ideas to learn by doing for the benefit of our client work.

Prior to launching EARN Studios, Jamal led the marketing teams at both Red Bull and Monster Energy where he was pivotal in developing their unique and entrepreneurial approach to marketing. He is co-author of Brand Love (link to book page) and is a non-executive director at Huel – the UK’s fastest growing brand which is aiming for a $1bn valuation within four years. In addition, he is an advisory board member for both Gousto and Anheuser-Busch. 

Jamal is also a top-rated keynote speaker at marketing, innovation and digital conferences around the world, and regularly gives talks and makes workshop appearances for brands that have a desire to grow and disrupt through their marketing. 

“I started EARN because I want to help brands understand how to grow their business faster with their consumers. At EARN we focus on developing products that are made for sharing and marketing that is designed to also be a new revenue stream.”

## How EARN works
We start by asking what the audience would love our client’s brand to invent for them, so if we do it well enough they’ll share it on our behalf. We dream big, experiment small. One of our most important principles is to work as quickly as we can on your toughest problems. The harder the solution the more we want to prove it can be done. In this way our ideas become stronger faster. We then work with the right partners to help us bring our ambitious ideas into the world.

## Clients
For us, it’s important to be sector agnostic. We work with businesses of all scales, from start-ups raising their first funding to global household names. What do they all have in common? Nothing, but an exciting outlook and the ambition to go the distance. If this is you, then get in touch!
