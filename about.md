## Who we are

We are a team of creatives, strategists, marketers, inventors and entrepreneurs from a wide variety of backgrounds and locations.

We love the challenge of the seemingly impossible and the potential to have an impact on millions of people’s lives.

## What we do

### Develop an entrepreneurial marketing plan to get the world talking about your brand![About-Huel.jpg](/uploads/About-Huel.jpg)

### Invent products that people want to share on our behalf![ee-01.jpg](/uploads/ee-01.jpg)

### Commercialise marketing to generate additional revenue streams![About-Kanpai.jpg](/uploads/About-Kanpai.jpg)

## **How we work**

We start by asking what the audience would love the brand to invent for them, so if we do it well enough they’ll share it on our behalf.

## **Brands**

We work with businesses of all scales, from start-ups to global household names.
