- title: Full time positions, freelancers and internships
  text: |-
    There are currently no permanent full-time positions available, but we do occasionally use freelancers and sometimes run paid internships.

    Typically internships run for a three-month period. Interns will enjoy valuable hands-on experience in a friendly, busy studio contributing directly to client projects.

    We always like to hear from talented people so do send a CV and examples of your work (no PDFs over 5MB please) to [work@earnstudios.com](mailto:work@hotfeet.earnstudios.com) and let us know which role you are looking for.
