# imgix.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/imgix/imgix.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/imgix/imgix.js)

**This documentation is for imgix.js version `3.0.0` and up. Those using imgix.js `2.x.x` can find documentation in that version's [readme](https://github.com/imgix/imgix.js/tree/2.2.3) and [API reference](https://github.com/imgix/imgix.js/blob/2.2.3/docs/api.md).**

**Note:** If you're looking for a Javascript library just to generate imgix URLs, check out [imgix-core-js](https://github.com/imgix/imgix-core-js).


imgix.js allows developers to easily generate responsive images using the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes, or the `picture` element. This lets you write a single image URL that is parsed and used to make images look great at any screen size, by using [imgix](https://imgix.com) to process and resize your images on the fly.

Responsive images in the browser, simplified. Pure JavaScript with zero dependencies. About 2 KB minified and gzipped.

## Overview / Resources

**Before you get started with imgix.js**, it's _highly recommended_ that you read Eric Portis' [seminal article on `srcset` and `sizes`](https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/). This article explains the history of responsive images in responsive design, why they're necessary, and how all these technologies work together to save bandwidth and provide a better experience for users. The primary goal of imgix.js is to make these tools easier for developers to implement, so having an understanding of how they work will significantly improve your imgix.js experience.

Below are some other articles that help explain responsive imagery, and how it can work alongside imgix:

* [Using imgix with `<picture>`](https://docs.imgix.com/tutorials/using-imgix-picture-element). Discusses the differences between art direction and resolution switching, and provides examples of how to accomplish art direction with imgix.
* [Responsive Images with `srcset` and imgix](https://docs.imgix.com/tutorials/responsive-images-srcset-imgix). A look into how imgix can work with `srcset` and `sizes` to serve the right image.


<a name="installation"></a>
## Installation

There are several ways to install imgix.js. The appropriate method depends on your project.

1. **npm**: `npm install --save imgix.js`
2. **Bower**: `bower install --save imgix.js`
3. **Manual**: [Download the latest release of imgix.js](https://github.com/imgix/imgix.js/releases/latest), and use `dist/imgix.js` or `dist/imgix.min.js`.

If your build process will re-run `dist/imgix.js` or `dist/imgix.min.js` through Browserify, you'll need to add `noParse: [require.resolve('imgix.js')]` to your Browserify config. If you skip this, Browserify will attempt to re-require imgix.js' dependencies, which have already been inlined.

After you've included imgix.js on your page, it will automatically run once, after the `DOMContentLoaded` event fires. This will detect and process all `img` and `source` tags on the page that are set up to use imgix.js as described in the [Usage](#usage) section of this README.


<a name="configuration"></a>
## Configuration

imgix.js has two important global options:

* `host`: Your imgix hostname (defaults to `null`). This enables the use of `ix-path` and `ix-params` to define images, instead of having to manually type URLs out in `ix-src`. See the [`ix-path` and `ix-params`](#ix-path-and-ix-params) section below for details.
* `useHttps`: A boolean (defaults to `true`), specifying whether to generate `http` or `https`-prefixed URLs.

These configuration options (as well as other options described in the ["Advanced Usage" section](#advanced-usage)) can be defined in two ways. The easiest way is to specify them with `meta` tags in your document's `<head>`:

``` html
<head>
  <meta property="ix:host" content="assets.imgix.net">
  <meta property="ix:useHttps" content="true">
</head>
```

The other way is to manually set these options on the `imgix.config` object. Note that these options should be set *after* loading `imgix.js`, but *before* the `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired on the page:

``` html
<script src="imgix.js"></script>
<script>
  imgix.config.host = 'assets.imgix.net';
  imgix.config.useHttps = false;
</script>
```

<a name="usage"></a>
## Usage

Now that everything's installed and set up, you can start adding responsive images to the page. There are a few ways to do this.

<a name="ix-src"></a>
### `ix-src`

The simplest way to use imgix.js is to create an `img` tag with the `ix-src` attribute:

``` html
<img
  ix-src="https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=300&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right"
  alt="A hot air balloon on a sunny day"
  sizes="100vw"
>
```

**Please note:** `100vw` is an appropriate `sizes` value for a full-bleed image. If your image is not full-bleed, you should use a different value for `sizes`. [Eric Portis' "Srcset and sizes"](https://ericportis.com/posts/2014/srcset-sizes/) article goes into depth on how to use the `sizes` attribute.

This will generate HTML something like the following:

``` html
<img
  ix-src="https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=300&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right"
  alt="A hot air balloon on a sunny day"
  sizes="100vw"
  srcset="
    https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=100&amp;h=167&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right 100w,
    https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=200&amp;h=333&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right 200w,
    â€¦
    https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=2560&amp;h=4267&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right 2560w
  "
  src="https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?w=300&amp;h=500&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=right"
  ix-initialized="ix-initialized"
>
```

Since imgix can generate as many derivative resolutions as needed, imgix.js calculates them programmatically, using the dimensions you specify (note that the `w` and `h` params scale appropriately to maintain the correct aspect ratio). All of this information has been placed into the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes. Because of this, imgix.js no longer needs to watch or change the `img` tag, as all responsiveness will be handled automatically by the browser as the page is resized.


<a name="ix-path-and-ix-params"></a>
### `ix-path` and `ix-params`

If you've [configured imgix.js](#configuration) with a global `host` option, you can use the `ix-path` and `ix-params` attributes instead of `ix-src`. The `ix-path` attribute is used to specify the path to your image, and the `ix-params` attribute is used to define the [ imgix URL API parameters](https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url) you'd like to apply to your image. Using these two attributes instead of `ix-src` has several advantages:

  1. `ix-params` automatically URL/Base64-encodes your specified parameters, [as appropriate](#base-64-encoded-parameters).
  2. `ix-params` is a JSON string, which is easier to read than a URL and can be generated by other tools if necessary.
  3. Not having to re-type `https://my-source.imgix.net` helps keep your code DRY.

Here's how the previous example would be written out using `ix-path` and `ix-params` instead of `ix-src`. Regardless of which method you choose, the end result in-browser will be the same.

``` html
<img
  ix-path="unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg"
  ix-params='{
    "w": 300,
    "h": 500,
    "fit": "crop",
    "crop": "right"
  }'
  alt="A hot air balloon on a sunny day"
>
```

**Please note**: `ix-params` must be a valid JSON string. This means that keys and string values must be surrounded by double quotes, e.g., `"fit": "crop"`.

<a name="picture-tags"></a>
### `picture` tags

If you need art-directed images, imgix.js plays nicely with the `picture` tag. This allows you to specify more advanced responsive images, by changing things such as the crop and aspect ratio for different screens. To get started, just construct a `picture` tag with a `source` attribute for each art-directed image, and a fallback `img` tag. If you're new to using the `picture` tag, you might want to check out our [tutorial](https://docs.imgix.com/tutorials/using-imgix-picture-element) to learn how it works.

The `source` tags can be used with `ix-src` or `ix-path` and `ix-params`, just like `img` tags. The following example will generate HTML that displays Bert _and_ Ernie on small screens, just Bert on medium-sized screens, and just Ernie on large screens.

``` html
<picture>
  <source
    media="(min-width: 880px)"
    sizes="430px"
    ix-path="imgixjs-demo-page/bertandernie.jpg"
    ix-params='{
      "w": 300,
      "h": 300,
      "fit": "crop",
      "crop": "left"
    }'
  >
  <source
    media="(min-width: 640px)"
    sizes="calc(100vw - 20px - 50%)"
    ix-path="imgixjs-demo-page/bertandernie.jpg"
    ix-params='{
      "w": 300,
      "h": 300,
      "fit": "crop",
      "crop": "right"
    }'
  >
  <source
    sizes="calc(100vw - 20px)"
    ix-path="imgixjs-demo-page/bertandernie.jpg"
    ix-params='{
      "w": 300,
      "h": 100,
      "fit": "crop"
    }'
  >
  <img ix-path="imgixjs-demo-page/bertandernie.jpg">
</picture>
```

<a name="advanced-usage"></a>
## Advanced Usage

<a name="overriding-ix-host"></a>
### Overriding `ix-host`

If you need to display images from multiple imgix Sources, the `host` option can be overridden on any `img` or `source` tag by specifying an `ix-host` attribute in the tag:

``` html
<img
  ix-host="a-different-source.imgix.net"
  ix-path="unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg"
  ix-params='{
    "w": 300,
    "h": 500,
    "fit": "crop",
    "crop": "right"
  }'
  alt="A hot air balloon on a sunny day"
>
```

<a name="disabling-auto-initialization"></a>
### Disabling auto-initialization

By default, imgix.js will automatically run as soon as the `DOMContentLoaded` event fires, immediately processing all `img` and `source` tags on the page that are set up to use imgix.js. You can disable this auto-initialization behavior by including the following `meta` tag in your document's `head`:

``` html
<head>
  <meta property="ix:autoInit" content="false">
</head>
```

<a name="manually-initializing-imgix-js"></a>
### Manually initializing imgix.js

If you disable auto-initialization as [described above](#disabling-auto-initialization), you'll need to manually run imgix.js in order to process the `img` and `source` tags on the page. You can do so by simply calling `imgix.init()`.

When calling `imgix.init()`, you can also pass in a map of options to override the global configuration settings. For example:

``` js
imgix.init({
  useHttps: false,
  host: 'a-different-source.imgix.net'
});
```

<a name="imgix-init-idempotency"></a>
### `imgix.init()` idempotency

Whether `imgix.init()` is run automatically when the `DOMContentLoaded` event fires or [manually initialized](#manually-initializing-imgix-js), it will always be **idempotent**. This means that `img` and `source` tags that have already been processed by imgix.js will not be re-processed by subsequent calls.

However, if you would like to re-process _all_ imgix.js-ready `img` and `source` tags, you can override the function's idempotency by calling `imgix.init()` again and passing in the `force: true` option:

``` js
imgix.init({
  force: true
})
```

<a name="lazy-loading-with-lazysizes"></a>
### Lazy Loading With [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes)

If you'd like to lazy load images, we recommend using [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes). In order to use imgix.js with lazysizes, you can simply tell it to generate lazysizes-compatible attributes instead of the standard `src`, `srcset`, and `sizes` by changing some configuration settings:

Using `<meta>` tags:

``` html
<head>
  <meta property="ix:srcAttribute" content="data-src">
  <meta property="ix:srcsetAttribute" content="data-srcset">
  <meta property="ix:sizesAttribute" content="data-sizes">
</head>
```

Using JavaScript:

``` javascript
imgix.config.srcAttribute = 'data-src';
imgix.config.srcsetAttribute = 'data-srcset';
imgix.config.sizesAttribute = 'data-sizes';
```

<a name="custom-input-attributes"></a>
### Custom Input Attributes

imgix.js defaults to pulling its data from the `ix-src`, `ix-path`, `ix-params`, and `ix-host` attributes. If you'd like to use custom input attributes, you can specify them by changing some configuration settings. This can be useful if you're concerned about W3C compliance.

Using `<meta>` tags:

``` html
<head>
  <meta property="ix:srcInputAttribute" content="data-ix-src">
  <meta property="ix:pathInputAttribute" content="data-ix-path">
  <meta property="ix:paramsInputAttribute" content="data-ix-params">
  <meta property="ix:hostInputAttribute" content="data-ix-host">
</head>
```

Using JavaScript:

``` javascript
imgix.config.srcInputAttribute = 'data-ix-src';
imgix.config.pathInputAttribute = 'data-ix-path';
imgix.config.paramsInputAttribute = 'data-ix-params';
imgix.config.hostInputAttribute = 'data-ix-host';
```

<a name="null-output-attributes"></a>
### Null Output Attributes

In rare cases, it may be undesirable to have imgix.js modify the `src`, `srcset`, or `sizes` attributes of the `<img>` elements it's targeting. In such cases, you can override the default behavior by setting some configuration values to null:

Using `<meta>` tags:

``` html
<head>
  <meta property="ix:srcAttribute" content="">
  <meta property="ix:srcsetAttribute" content="">
  <meta property="ix:sizesAttribute" content="">
</head>
```

Using JavaScript:

``` javascript
imgix.config.srcAttribute = null;
imgix.config.srcsetAttribute = null;
imgix.config.sizesAttribute = null;
```

<a name="base-64-encoded-parameters"></a>
### Base-64 encoded parameters

All of imgix's API parameters can be provided as [Base64 variants](https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url#base64-variants). This is especially useful when providing text for the `txt` parameter, or URLs for parameters such as `mark` or `blend`.

When providing parameters to imgix.js via the `ix-params` attribute, note that the values for any Base64 variant parameters will be automatically base64-encoded by imgix.js, and can therefore be provided *unencoded*.

``` html
<img
  ix-path="unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg"
  ix-params='{
    "txt64": "Hello, World!"
  }'
  alt="A hot air balloon on a sunny day"
>
```

When providing a URL with parameters to imgix.js via the `ix-src` attribute, note that the values for any Base64 variant parameters will *not* be automatically base64-encoded by imgix.js.

``` html
<img
  ix-src="https://assets.imgix.net/unsplash/hotairballoon.jpg?txt64=SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ"
  alt="A hot air balloon on a sunny day"
  sizes="100vw"
>
```


<a name="what-is-the-ixlib-param"></a>
### What is the `ixlib` param?

For security and diagnostic purposes, we default to signing all requests with the language and version of library used to generate the URL. This can be disabled by setting the `includeLibraryParam` configuration option to `false`.

Using a `<meta>` tag:

``` html
<head>
  <meta property="ix:includeLibraryParam" content="false">
</head>
```

Using JavaScript:

``` javascript
imgix.config.includeLibraryParam = false;
```


<a name="browser-support"></a>
## Browser Support

* By default, browsers that don't support [`srcset`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=srcset), [`sizes`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=srcset), or [`picture`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=picture) will gracefully fall back to the default `img` `src` when appropriate. If you want to provide a fully-responsive experience for these browsers, imgix.js works great alongside [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill)!
* If you are using [Base64 variant params](https://docs.imgix.com/apis/url#base64-variants) and need IE <= 9 support, we recommend using a polyfill for `atob`/`btoa`, such as [Base64.js](https://github.com/davidchambers/Base64.js).
